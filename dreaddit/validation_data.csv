The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year.

I'm tired of watching my back, tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe, tired of reliving that moment, tired of being triggered, tired of the stress, tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach, tired of irrational thought when triggered, tired of irrational paranoia. I'm exhausted and need a break, but know it won't be enough until I journey the long road through therapy.

We are looking for people who are willing to complete some online questionnaires about employment and well-being which we hope will help us to improve services for assisting people with mental health difficulties to obtain and retain employment. We are developing an employment questionnaire for people with personality disorders; however we are looking for people from all backgrounds to complete it. That means you do not need to have a diagnosis of personality disorder – you just need to have an interest in completing the online questionnaires. The questionnaires will only take about 10 minutes to complete online. For your participation, we’ll donate £1 on your behalf to a mental health charity (Young Minds: Child & Adolescent Mental Health, Mental Health Foundation, or Rethink).",10442,0,1.0,1539269312,2,11.06067518,134,79.52,97.34,2.27,80.01,22.33,25.37,84.33,48.51,12.69,8.21,0.0,4.48,3.73,0.0,0.0,4.48,5.22,16.42,9.7,4.48,2.99,0.75,17.16,4.48,0.0,1.49,2.24,1.49,5.22,3.73,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.45,2.24,0.0,2.24,2.24,2.99,2.24,1.49,1.49,0.0,0.0,3.73,0.0,3.73,0.0,0.0,11.19,5.97,2.24,1.49,2.24,0.75,0.0,11.94,2.99,6.72,0.0,2.99,2.99,4.48,0.0,0.0,1.49,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,14.18,5.97,2.24,0.75,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.75,0.0,1.49,1.49,0.75,3.0,2.8889,3.0,1.125,1.125,1.0,1.79768,1.49074,1.92286,1.0,1,9.951523723,0.045454545
